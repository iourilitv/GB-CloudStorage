To DELETE folder!

Completed the authorizing task for this stage.
Moved two methods(for auth) from the TCPServer class into the ServiceCommandHandler class of the server module and deleted old code there. All work correctly.
The following scenarios work:
*Scenario "upload a file":
 - The client sends to the server a CommandMessage with a request "upload the file from the client directory to the user's directory in the storage" with the file data inside;
 - The server reads the file data, saves it into a new file and sends back a CommandMessage about a result;
*Scenario "download a file":
 - The client sends to the server a CommandMessage with a request "download the file from the user's directory in the storage to the client directory";
 - The server reads the file and sends back a CommandMessage with the file data;
 - The client saves the file.
